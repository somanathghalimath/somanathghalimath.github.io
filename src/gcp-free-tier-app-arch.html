<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #666699;">Powering a Personal App with Cloud Services</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px; ; padding-right: 30px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the post-pandemic world cloud computing has gained a renewed attention and appreciation, that it rightly deserves. But normally when we think of cloud computing, we tend to think of enterprises, data in TBs, transactions in millions etc. While cloud perfectly fits the bill for all those computing intensive aspects. There is a big piece of the metaphorical cloud's pie that we as individual users are missing. Almost all cloud service providers have a free-tier made available to the customers. If one keeps in mind the limits of free usage, it is possible to utilize the cloud services to build a personal app, this makes the process of adaption of Cloud much more exciting and satisfying because at the end of the day, we will have a working application as an artifact as the output of this exercise on an individual level</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px; ; padding-right: 30px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With this goal in mind to create a personal app while remaining within free tier and making use of as many cloud services as the limitation allows, I started the process. First I had to decide on which Cloud service provider I would make use of. After comparing the service providers, I zeroed in on Google Cloud Platform(GCP) because it provided a lifetime of free services renewed each month(subject to change), this made much more sense since this app would reside in the cloud and serve my needs for a long time and actually leave me in control when to terminate the application. The next challenge was to figure out what I wanted to build. This pandemic in particular has brought about one change in our lives, it has made us reach out to people in our lives who really matter, the friends from our highschool, from our college, from our first jobs etc. Pre-pandemic busy life had left us numb and at a loss of energy to keep these friends close. As is part of life when we gain something we lose something, so some loss in terms of personnel would be there. But without digressing into the philosopy of life, I will come to the point. I planned to create a simple reminder application to remind me of upcoming important event in a friend's life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px; ; padding-right: 30px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I created this simple reminder app and shared a simple demo with a close friend of mine, who is also an expert talented software developer. She told me you could make it a bit more complex and explore other services maybe if the price is reaching outside the free-tier then you could not let it go live but this design can be made more challenging. So that led to me on a thought trip where I decided expand the scope of the application and involve other cloud services in a way to make the app a bit more appealing but I was determined to remain within the free tier. So with that thought in mind, the final idea for the application became something of this sort.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px; ; padding-right: 30px;">The basic feature to send an email notification would still be there</li>
<li style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px; ; padding-right: 30px;">The email would have a template with images stored in Storage</li>
<li style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px; ; padding-right: 30px;">The email would have some interesting fact of the day</li>
<li style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px; ; padding-right: 30px;">The application would have a back-office admin webpage to fine tune the email template, images, add new dates to the master-data etc</li>
<li style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px; ; padding-right: 30px;">The application would also have a webpage that would serve the fact of the day.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px; ; padding-right: 30px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The back-end architecture would now look something like this.</p>
