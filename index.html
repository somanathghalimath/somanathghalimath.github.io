<h1>OCR-NER prototype for Data Masking</h1>
<p>
The idea behind this application prototype was simple. There are commercial OCR applications available in the market as well as NER trained models. So the idea was to integrate these two, there is a very strong usecase for this application. There is a large dataset of documents that are scanned and stored across organizations which contains valuable data in form of Named Entities, for that matter the data that is valuable can be trained as models to extract.
  
With this thought process, I started researching what are the gold-standard open libraries available for OCR and NER. 

OCR - Optical Character Recognition, a process of identifying the printed character using a machine. The gold standard open library available for OCR is Tesseract - orginally developed by HP as a proprietary product but later released as Open Source in 2005 and been actively maintained by Google since 2006.

NER - The widely accepted gold standard in NER is Stanford CoreNLP.

The next challenge was to find a language that can used for implementation and integration.
